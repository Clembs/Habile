      **Adding content:**
      ‚Ä¢ Feel free to suggest adding content that is wanted or you think is relevant
      ‚Ä¢ Before adding a channel, make sure that it isn't already in one of the archives, if so bring that back instead
      ‚Ä¢ If I intentionally removed something, ask me why before bringing it back
      
      **Moderation:**
      ‚Ä¢ Be friendly to everyone, but don't hesitate on using your powers if something goes out of hand
      ‚Ä¢ Keep the server on-brand and teen friendly too, so apply to the rules, make people apply to them, avoid drama, insults, mean stuff, etc
      ‚Ä¢ Whenever possible, use CRBT's moderation commands instead of Discord's built-ins
